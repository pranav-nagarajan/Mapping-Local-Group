# Introduction

This aim of this project is to produce a central repository of high-quality, self-consistent, RR Lyrae-based distance moduli to Local Group dwarf galaxies. The distances are derived by simultaneously fitting the Period-Wesenheit Magnitude-Metallicity relationship for all galaxies using MCMC sampling based on a Bayesian hierarchical model. Currently, the distances are anchored to Gaia EDR3 parallaxes to Milky Way RRab stars with known optical light curves and spectroscopic metallicities.
